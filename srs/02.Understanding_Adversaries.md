- Insiders
  - First-party: employees, interns, executives, etc
  - Third-party: third-party app developers, open source contributors, vendors, etc
  - Related: friends, family, etc

  通常在考虑insiders时，reliablity和security有较大的重叠部分，系统reliability往往会因为insiders的错误操作、引入的故障组件导致出现问题，**系统设计时，应充分考虑insiders的操作，无论是恶意的还是无意的，从而可以同时提升reliability和security**

## Attacker Methods

- Cyber Kill Chain
- Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
