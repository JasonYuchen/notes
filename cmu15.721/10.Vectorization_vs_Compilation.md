# Lecture 10 - Vectorization vs. Compilation

基本解读了[论文内容](Compiled_Vectorized_Queries.md)

- Approach #1: Tectorwise, **vectorization**
  - Break operations into pre-compiled primitives.
  - Must materialize the output of primitives at each step.

- Approach #2: Typer, **data-centric code generation**
  - Push-based processing model with JIT compilation.
  - Process a single tuple up entire pipeline without 
materializing the intermediate results

## Thoughts

> No major performance difference between the Vectorwise and HyPer approaches for all queries.
>
> Data-centric is better for "**calculation-heavy**" queries with few cache misses.
> Vectorization is slightly better at **hiding cache miss latencies**. (e.g. joins)
