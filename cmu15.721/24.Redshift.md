## Industry-leading security and access control, out-of-the box at no additional cost

- AWS security standards and compliance certifications
- **Granular authorization at row and column level**
- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) support
- Identity management and federation
- Sensitive data protection with dynamic data masking
- Auditing and compliance

## Cross-AZ cluster recovery

- avoid resource constraints in the current AZ during resume/resize
- zero data loss (RPO = 0)
- no need to restore from a snapshot
- on-demand, avoid cost of a standby cluster

***separate storage and compute***

## Continuous telemetry and benchmarking

> 3x faster between May'18 and Oct'18

- short query acceleration
- qeury result caching
- compiled code cache
- query rewrites for selective joins
- hash join memory utilization
- **faster string manipulation**
  advanced string compression encoding for different cardinality:
  - low cardinality, e.g. `Y/N` for true/false
  - medium cardinality, e.g. country names
  - high cardinality, e.g. timestamps
- cache line prefetching for hash joins and hash aggregations
- late materialization

## Auto Maintenance Operations

- Automatic Table Optimization
- Auto-Analyze
- Auto-Vacuum (delete, full)
- Atuo-Materialized View Refresh
