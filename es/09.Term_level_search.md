# Chapter 09 Term-level search

## Overview of term-level search

- Term-level queries return results in **exact matches**
  - not analyzed
  - not tokenized
  - **normalized**
- **Runnable but unsuitable for text fields**
  - or text fields that contains data in the form of **enumerations or constants**
- Suitable fro non-text fields like keyword, numerical, date

## The term-level query

- **term**
- **terms**
  - terms lookup: build a query based on values obtained from another document
- **ids**
- **exists**
- **range**
  - `gt`: greater than
  - `gte`: greater than or equal to
  - `lt`: less than
  - `lte`: less than or equal to
- **wildcard**
  - `*`: 0 or more characters
  - `?`: 1 character
- **prefix**
  - use `index_prefixes` in index creation to improve performance
- **fuzzy**
  - use `AUTO` to determine the edit distance based on the length of the word

Expensive queries (`range`, `wildcard`, `prefix`, `fuzzy`, `regex`) may impact server performance
