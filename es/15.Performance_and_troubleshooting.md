# Chapter 15 Performance and troubleshooting

## Search and speed problems

[Best Practices](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/tune-for-search-speed.html)

- **Modern hardware**
- **Document modeling**
    - NoSQL data modeling principles, **denormalized data** (no/few nested and parent-child operations)
    - limit searching multiple fields, consider `copy_to` to **combine fields** and restrict searching fields (individual fields are still searchable), e.g.

      ```
      PUT programming_books
      {
        "mappings": {
          "properties": {
            "title": {
              "type": "text",
              "copy_to": "title_synopsis"
            },
            "synopsis": {
              "type": "text",
              "copy_to": "title_synopsis"
            },
            "title_synopsis": {
              "type": "text"
            }
          }
        }
      }

      GET programming_books/_search
      {
        "query": {
          "match": {  <- more performant than a multi-match
            "title_synopsis": {  <- same as searching title & synopsis as data are combined in this title_synopsis
              "query": "elastic search"
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```

- **Choosing keyword types over text types**
    - text analysis is computing-intensive
    - use multi-field and avoid text search where possible
- **Pre-index data**
    - e.g. based on the query pattern, convert the metric aggregation to a term aggregation
- **Avoid scripts**
- **Search rounded dates**
    - `now` is typically not cacheable
- **Force-merge read-only indices**
    - read-only indices, e.g. time-based indices can be merged to a single performant segment
- **Warmup global ordinals**
- **Index sorting**
    - make conjunctions faster at the cost of slightly slower indexing
    - early termination in search
- **User `preference` to optimize cache utilization**
    - common to run similar requests one after another, make use of this to guide the cache usage
- **Faster phrases queries with `index_phrases`**
- **Faster prefixes queries with `index_prefixes`**
- **Avoid monolithic index**
    - if most queries perform same filter on one field, and this field has same value for most documents, consider **moving these documents to a dedicate index**
- **Search profiler**

## Index speed problems

[Best Practice](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/tune-for-indexing-speed.html)

- **System-generated identifiers**
    - user-supplied IDs have to be checked for duplication, use system-generated IDs to reduce overhead
- **Bulk requests**
- **Adjusting the refresh rate**
- **Disable replicas for initial loads**
- **Cross-cluster replication**
    - to avoid searching from stealing resources from indexing, i.e. **separation of read/write**
- **Avoid hot spotting**

## Unstable clusters

- **Cluster is not GREEN**
    - **RED**: muse be addressed at any cost
    - **YELLOW**: trouble is waiting to happen
- **Unassigned shards**
    - usually happens during rebalancing of the shards due to node failures
    - use `allocation` API to check the unassigned nature of shards, and fix accordingly
- **Disk-usage thresholds**
    - **Low-disk watermark**: 85%
    - **High-disk watermark**: 90%
    - **Flood-stage-disk watermark**: 95%, all indexes on this node will be made non-writable

## Circuit breakers

Failure of RPC from **non-responsive or slow services** are common in distributed systems

Elasticsearch implements circuit breakers to conteract problems that hamper a client's progress, and will throws meaningful  error if specific circuit breakers are triggered

Type of circuit breakers:

- **Parent**: **total memory** that can be used across all circuit breakers, `indices.breaker.total.limit`
- **Inflight requests**: sum of total memory of **all inflight requests**, `network.breaker.inflight_requests.limit`
- **Request**: prevent exceeding the heap memory to serve a **single request**, `indices.breaker.request.limit`
- **Field data**: prevent exceeding the heap memory to **load fields into the cache**, `indices.breaker.fielddata.limit`
- **Accounting requests**: avoid **accumulating memory** after the request is served, `indices.breaker.accounting.limit`
- **Script compilation**: limits the number of inline compilations in a time window, `script.max_compilations_rate`
