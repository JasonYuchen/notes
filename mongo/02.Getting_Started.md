# Chapter 02 Getting Started

- *document* is the basic unit of data (similar to a row in RDBMS)
- *collection* is similar to a table with a dynamic schema
- every document has a primary key, `_id`, that is unique within a collection

## Documents

`{"greeting" : "Hello", "views" : 3}`

- **Keys**

    Any UTF-8 character except for `\0` (signify the end of a key),  `.` and `$` (special properties), cannot contain duplicate keys in a document

- **Values**

    can be one of several different data types including an entire embedded document

## Collections

A group of documents

- **Dynamic Schemas**
- **Naming**
- **Subcollections**: namespaced subcollections separated by the `.` for **organizational purposes** only, there is no relationship between subcollections

## Databases

A group of collections, some reserved system databases:

- `admin`: used in authentication and authorization
- `local`: stores data specific to a single server, e.g. used in replication process
- `config`: stores information about each shard for sharded MongoDB clusters

## Data Types

- **Null**: `{"x" : null}`
- **Boolean**: `{"x" : true}`
- **Number**: `{"x" : 3.14}` , `{"x" : NumberLong("3")}`
- **String**: `{"x" : "foobar"}`
- **Date**: `{"x" : new Date()}`
- **Regular expression**: `{"x" : /foobar/i}`
- **Array**: `{"x" : ["a", "b", "c"]}
- **Embedded document**: `{"x" : {"foo" : "bar"}}`
- **Object ID**: 12-byte ID for documents, `{"x" : ObjectId()}`, e.g. `00000020f51bb4362eee2a4d`

    - **4-byte timestamp**, representing the ObjectId's creation, measured in seconds since the Unix epoch, e.g. `00000020`.
    - **5-byte random value generated once per process**. This random value is unique to the machine and process, e.g. `f51bb4362e`.
    - **3-byte incrementing counter**, initialized to a random value, e.g. `ee2a4d`, guarantee its uniqueness across machines and processes for a single second, up to `256^3` (16777216) unique object ids per process per second.

- **Binary data**: cannot be manipulated from the shell, the only way to save non-UTF-8 strings
- **Code**: arbitrary JavaScript code, `{"x" : function() { /* ... */ }}`
