## Indexes for Full Text Search

MongoDB **Atlas** Full-Text Search Indexes utilize Apache Lucene for additional text search capabilities

Creating a text index can consume a large amount of system resources, and it is usually more expensive that writes involving text indexes.

```
> db.articles.createIndex({"title": "text", 
                           "body": "text"},
                          {"weights" : {
                               "title" : 3, 
                               "body" : 2}})
```

`$text` query operator will tokenize the search string using **whitespace and most punctuation** as delimiters, and perform a **logical OR** of all such tokens in the search string.

```
> db.articles.find({"$text": {"$search": "impact crater lunar"}}, 
                   {title: 1}
                  ).limit(10)
{ "_id" : "170375", "title" : "Chengdu" }
{ "_id" : "34331213", "title" : "Avengers vs. X-Men" }
```

Use phrase to perform a **logical AND** (`"\"impact\" lunar"` means `impact AND lunar`) and make use of scores

```
> db.articles.find({$text: {$search: "\"impact crater\" lunar"}},
                   {title: 1, score: {$meta: "textScore"}}).sort({score: {$meta: "textScore"}}).limit(10)
{"_id": "1621514", "title": "Lunar craters", "score": 3.1655242042922014}
{"_id": "14580008", "title": "Kuiper quadrangle", "score": 3.0847527829208814}
```

Create a compound index with a **prefix to optimize/partition the full-text index**

```
> db.blog.createIndex({"date" : 1, "post" : "text"})
```

text indexes support [various languages](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/text-search-languages/#text-search-languages)

```
> db.users.createIndex({"profil" : "text", 
                        "intérêts" : "text"}, 
                       {"default_language" : "french"})

> db.users.insert({"username" : "swedishChef", 
... "profile" : "Bork de bork", language : "swedish"})
```

## Capped Collections

Capped collection is created in advance and is **fixed in size**, behaves like circular queues that **automatically age out the oldest documents** as new documents are inserted.

Capped collections **cannot be sharded**.

```
> db.createCollection("my_collection", {"capped" : true, "size" : 100000, "max": 100});
```

## Time-To-Live Indexes

MongoDB sweeps the TTL index **once per minute**

```
> // 24-hour timeout
> db.sessions.createIndex({"lastUpdated" : 1}, {"expireAfterSeconds" : 60*60*24})
```

## Storing Files with GridFS

GridFS is generally best when you have **large files** you’ll be accessing in a **sequential fashion** that **won’t be changing much**.

- simplify your stack, with GridFS, you do not need to use a separate tool for file storage
- GridFS will leverage any existing replication or auto-sharding that you've set up for MongoDB
- GridFS can alleviate some of the issues that certain filesystems can exhibit

GridFS is a lightweight specification for storing files that is built **on top of normal MongoDB documents**. The basic idea behind GridFS is that we can store **large files by splitting them up into chunks** and storing each chunk as a separate document.

- `files_id`: the `_id` of the file that contains the metadata for this file
- `n`: this chunk's position in the file
- `data`: the bytes in this chunk
- `_id`: unique ID for the file
- `length`: total number of bytes of this file
- `chunkSize`: the size of each chunk, default is 255KB
- `uploadDate`
- `md5`: MD5 checksum of this file's contents, generated on the server side
