# Chapter 20 Durability

## Durability at the Member Level Through Journaling

MongoDB uses a **write-ahead log (WAL)** called the journal to provide durability in the event of a server failure.

By default, MongoDB flushes journal entries to disk every 50 ms and flushes database files (checkpointing) to disk every 60 s.

Journal writes are used to provide durability for data written since the last checkpoint, **the greatest extent of lost writes** are those made in the last 100 ms plus the time it takes to flush the journal writes to disk.

## Durability at the Cluster Level Using Write Concern

- **The `w` and `wtimeout` Options for `writeConcern`

    only when a majority of the members get the write, application will see an acknowledgement. if the write cannot be replicated to a majority in the `wtimeout`, application will see an error. **MongoDB will not rollback the writes in successful members if timeout**, it will be up to the application to choose how to handle timeouts.

- **The `j` (Journaling) Option for `writeConcern`

    request **acknowledgement that the write operation has been written to the journal** by using the `j` option in the `writeConcern` (`j: true`)

```
try {
   db.products.insertOne(
       { sku: "H1100335456", item: "Electric Toothbrush Head", quantity: 3 },
       { writeConcern: { w : "majority", wtimeout : 100, j : true } }
   );
} catch (e) {
   print (e);
}
```

## Durability at a Cluster Level Using Read Concern

They should not be confused with `readPreferences`, which deal with where the data is read from.

- `local`: return data with no guarantees that the data has been written to the majority or not, may be rolled back
- `majority`: return data that have been committed by the majority, won't be rolled back
- `linearizable`: data returned reflects all successful majority-acked writes that have completed prior to the start of the read operations, **may need to wait for concurrently executing writes** to finish

## Durability of Transactions Using a Write Concern

**Avoid multi-document transactions** by schema design (embedded documents and arrays)

MongoDB provides the ability to perform multi-document transactions against replica sets across **multiple operations, documents, collections, and databases**.

**`writeconcern` should be set at the transaction level**, not at the individual operation level (will be ignored).

```
function updateEmployeeInfo(session) {
    employeesCollection = session.getDatabase("hr").employees;
    eventsCollection = session.getDatabase("reporting").events;

    session.startTransaction( {writeConcern: { w: "majority" } } );

    try{
        employeesCollection.updateOne( { employee: 3 }, 
                                       { $set: { status: "Inactive" } } );
        eventsCollection.insertOne( { employee: 3, status: { new: "Inactive", 
                                      old: "Active" } } );
    } catch (error) {
        print("Caught exception during transaction, aborting.");
        session.abortTransaction();
        throw error;
    }

    commitWithRetry(session);
}
```

## What MongoDB Does Not Guarantee

e.g. hardware issues, filesystem bugs

Basically, MongoDB is only **as safe as the underlying system**

## Checking for Corruption

```
db.movies.validate({full: true})
{
	"ns" : "sample_mflix.movies",
	"nInvalidDocuments" : NumberLong(0),
	"nrecords" : 45993,
	"nIndexes" : 5,
	"keysPerIndex" : {
		"_id_" : 45993,
		"$**_text" : 3671341,
		"genres_1_imdb.rating_1_metacritic_1" : 94880,
		"tomatoes_rating" : 45993,
		"getMovies" : 45993
	},
	"indexDetails" : {
		"$**_text" : {
			"valid" : true
		},
		"_id_" : {
			"valid" : true
		},
		"genres_1_imdb.rating_1_metacritic_1" : {
			"valid" : true
		},
		"getMovies" : {
			"valid" : true
		},
		"tomatoes_rating" : {
			"valid" : true
		}
	},
	"valid" : true,
	"warnings" : [ ],
	"errors" : [ ],
	"extraIndexEntries" : [ ],
	"missingIndexEntries" : [ ],
	"ok" : 1
}
```
