# Chapter 01 The Method

> There are many options of doing pretty much anything. For the master architect, however, there are only a few good options, and typically only one.

## What Is The Method?

*The Method = System Design + Project Design*

- System design: breaking down a big system into small modular components
- Project design: helping you provide management with several options for building the system

### Design Validation

- validate the design **early**
- address the **customer requirements**
- address the organization/team **capabilities and constraints**

### Time Crunch

- Why not **spend 10 days on the architecture**? Not event a rounding error measured against a system lifetime of years.

### Eliminating Analysis-Paralysis

- Design Decisions Tree
	- start at the root of the tree, avoiding rework prior decisions
	- apply constraints increasingly to prune the tree

### Communication

A good design is one that was **well conceived**, survived through development, and ended up as working bits on customer machines.

*The Method* provides the **right vocabulary and metrics** for communicating with decision makers in a simple and concise way.

## What The Method Is Not

*The Method* provides a good starting point for system and project design, along with a list of the things to avoid. *The Method* does not guarantee success and may make matters worse if used in isolation from anything else in the project or just for the sake of using it.
