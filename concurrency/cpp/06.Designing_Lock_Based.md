# Chapter 06. Designing Lock-based Concurrent Data Structures

## 并发设计的含义

并发数据结构的要求：

- Ensure that no thread can see a state where the **invariants of the data structure** have been broken by the actions of another thread.
- Take care to **avoid race conditions** inherent in the interface to the data structure by providing functions for complete operations rather than for operation steps.
- Pay attention to how the data structure behaves in the **presence of exceptions** to ensure that the invariants are not broken.
- Minimize the opportunities for **deadlock** when using the data structure by restricting the scope of locks and avoiding nested locks where possible.

当设计并发数据结构时需要考虑的问题：

- Can **the scope of locks** be restricted to allow some parts of an operation to be performed outside the lock?
- Can **different parts of the data** structure be protected with different mutexes?
- Do all operations require the same **level of protection**?
- Can a simple change to the data structure improve the **opportunities for concurrency** without affecting the operational semantics?
