# Chapter 01 A Taste of What You're Up Against: Two Tales

## Joan's Diary of Lessons Learned, Part I

- **choose a driver carefully**, it's at the core of the application's performance, robustness, and reliability
    - officially supported driver
    - open-source driver
    - driver with well-established release schedule
- **drivers have bugs too**

## Joan's Diary of Lessons Learned, Part II

- client-side timeouts are convenient for programmers, but they can interact badly with server-side timeouts
    - rule of thumb: **make the client-side timeouts ~2x server-side ones**
    - speculative retry should resend requests only when the original one is very likely failed, i.e. **avoid overeager retry**
- tasks with seemingly fixed concurrency can actually cause spikes (timeout + retry)
    - bonus points for **distributed tracing**

## Patrick's Diary of Lessons Learned, Part I

- **analysis for your own needs** before selecting a database
    - predictable, steady flow of requests? e.g. updates being fetched from other systems periodically
    - high variance and hard to predict? e.g. idle for long periods of time with occasional bumps of activity
- **give time to evaluate**, avoid committing to long-term contracts

## Patrick's Diary of Lessons Learned, Part II

- **be prepared for spikes** (if workload is susceptible to spikes), try to architect the cluster to be able to **survive a temporarily elevated load**
- **always expect spikes**, even the workload is absolutely steady, but occasional exceptions like hardware failure can cause a sharp increase in requests
- **observability is key in distributed systems**

## Patrick's Diary of Lessons Learned, Part III

- **backups are vital**
- every database system has a certain consistency model, it's crucial to **take consistency model into account** when designing a project

## Patrick's Diary of Lessons Learned, Part IV

- **little's law**, $L=\lambda W$, concurrency equals throughput (1/s) times latency (s)
- **limit the concurrency as early as possible**

## Patrick's Diary of Lessons Learned, Part V

- database systems are hardly ever idle even without requests, maintenance operations often happen, they are **internal source of concurrency and resource consumption**
- whenever possible, **schedule maintenance options for times with expected low pressure** on the system
- investigate **quality of service configuration** if possible, e.g.
    - set a **strong priority for user requests** over regular maintenance operations, e.g. LSM compaction
    - periods with low user-induced activity can be utilized to speed up background activities

*Meeting database performance expectations can sometimes seem like a never-ending pain.*
