# Chapter 06 Getting Data Closer

## Databases as Compute Engines

### User-Defined Functions and Procedures

Core strategies that are often implemented:

- **native functions**, not extensible, but at least composable, e.g. type casting, concatenating, etc
- **custom scripting language**, vendor-locked to a specific database
- **single general-purpose embeddable language**, e.g. Lisp, Lua, WebAssembly, etc
- **a variety of pluggable embeddable language**

When using UDF, take care of:

- **Determinism**: UDF should only depend on the value of its arguments, and not on the value of any external factors like time, date, etc
- **Latency**: UDF may use loops, recursion, Wasmtime (WebAssembly runtime) provides a *metering mechanism* to limit the system resources a WebAssembly instance is consuming
- **Just-in-Time Compilation, JIT**: JIT itself also consumes system resources

**Best Practices**

- evaluate if you need UDFs at all
- test if offloading computations to the database scales
- optimize and benchmark the UDFs
- properly handle errors and exceptional cases
- use built-in functions whenever possible instead of UDFs
- keep UDFs simple and modular
- properly document UDFs

### User-Defined Aggregates

Components

- **Initial Value**
- **State Transition Function**
- **Final Function**
- **Reduce Function**

**Best Practices**

- use built-in aggregates whenever possible instead of UDAs
- investigate if UDAs can be distributed to multiple nodes with reduce function
- optimize and benchmark the UDAs
- measure the cluster-wide effects since aggregates are costly and may affect the quality of service of other workloads

### WebAssembly for User-Defined Functions

    - "Programming WebAssembly with Rust" by Kevin Hoffman
    - "ScyllaDBâ€™s Take on WebAssembly for User-DefinedFunctions" by Piotr Sarna
- scheduling mechanism: ***fuel***, which helps maintain low, predictable latency in the whole system
- portability

## Edge Computing

performing computations on servers closer to the user

- **Performance**: having database cluster distributed to multiple locations closer to the user has its downsides
    - charge cross-region traffic
    - database node may get out of sync easily
    - failure detection mechanism may be flaky
    - database drivers need to be aware of these limitations
- **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types**
    - G-Counter: grow-only counter
    - PN-Counter: positive-negative counter by keeping two G-Counter
    - G-Set: grow-only set
    - LWW-Set: Last-write-win set by keeping two G-Set
    - other
